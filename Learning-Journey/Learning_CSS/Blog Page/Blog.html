        When do you think people die? When they are shot through the heart by
        the bullet of a pistol? No! When they are ravaged by an incurable
        disease? No! When they drink a soup made from a poisonous mushroom? No!
        It's when… they are forgotten

        One Piece is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro
        Oda. It follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy and his crew, the
        Straw Hat Pirates, as he explores the Grand Line in search of the
        mythical treasure known as the "One Piece" to become the next King of
        the Pirates.The manga has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga
        magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 1997, with its chapters compiled
        in 112 tankōbon volumes as of July 2025. It was licensed for an English
        language release in North America and the United Kingdom by Viz Media
        and in Australia by Madman Entertainment.

        One Piece is set on the Blue Planet, populated by humans and other races
        such as dwarves (more akin to fairies in size), giants, merfolk,
        fish-men, long-limbed tribes, long-necked people known as the Snakeneck
        Tribe, and animal people, known as "Minks". The Blue Planet is governed
        by an authoritarian intercontinental organization known as the World
        Government, consisting of dozens of member countries. The Navy is the
        military branch of the World Government that protects the known seas
        from pirates and other criminals.

        Pirates are evil? The Marines are righteous? These terms have always
        changed throughout the course of history! Kids who have never seen peace
        and kids who have never seen war have different values! Those who stand
        at the top determine what's wrong and what's right! This very place is
        neutral ground! Justice will prevail, you say? But of course it will!
        Whoever wins this war becomes justice!

        Cipher Pol acts as the World Government's secret police. While pirates
        are major opponents of the Government, the ones who challenge their rule
        are the Revolutionary Army who seek to overthrow them. The central
        tension of the series pits the World Government and their forces against
        pirates. The series regularly emphasizes moral ambiguity over the label
        "pirate", which includes morally bankrupt individuals motivated by
        selfish gains, but also any individuals who do not submit to the World
        Government's authoritarian—and often morally ambiguous—rule. The One
        Piece world also has supernatural objects such as Devil Fruits,[Jp 1]
        which are mysterious fruits that grant whoever eats them transformative
        powers at the cost of becoming weakened in bodies of water, resulting in
        them losing the ability to swim. Another supernatural power is Haki,[Jp
        2] which grants its users enhanced observation and fighting abilities
        based on their willpower; it is one of the only effective methods of
        inflicting bodily harm on certain Devil Fruit users.

        The surface of the Blue Planet mainly consists of the Blue Sea, two vast
        oceans divided by a massive continental mountain range called the Red
        Line.[Jp 3] Within the oceans is a second global phenomenon known as the
        Grand Line,[Jp 4] which is a sea that runs perpendicular to the Red Line
        and is bounded by the Calm Belt,[Jp 5] strips of calm ocean infested
        with huge ship-eating monsters known as Sea Kings.[Jp 6] These
        geographical barriers divide the world into four seas: North Blue,[Jp 7]
        East Blue,[Jp 8] West Blue,[Jp 9] and South Blue.[Jp 10] Passage between
        the four seas, and the Grand Line, is therefore difficult. Unique and
        mystical features enable transport between the seas, such as the use of
        Sea Prism Stone[Jp 11] employed by government ships to mask their
        presence as they traverse the Calm Belt, or the Reverse Mountain[Jp 12]
        where water from the four seas flows uphill before merging into a
        rapidly flowing and dangerous canal that enters the Grand Line. The
        Grand Line itself is split into two separate halves, with the Red Line
        between being Paradise[Jp 13] and the New World.[Jp 14]
