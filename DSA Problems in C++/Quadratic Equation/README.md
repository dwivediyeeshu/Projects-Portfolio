# Quadratic Equation Roots

## ðŸ“Œ Problem

```text
Given a quadratic equation axÂ² + bx + c = 0, 
you have to find its roots. 

If the equation has real roots, then return the floor value of each root in decreasing order.  
If the roots are imaginary return -1, the driver code will print "Imaginary".

Examples:

Input: a = 1, b = -2, c = 1
Output: 1 1
Explanation: Roots of equation xÂ² - 2x + 1 are 1 and 1.

Input: a = 1, b = -7, c = 12
Output: 4 3
Explanation: Roots of equation xÂ² - 7x + 12 are 4 and 3.

Constraints:
-10^3 â‰¤ a, b, c â‰¤ 10^3
